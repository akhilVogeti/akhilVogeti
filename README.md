## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious chap who is interested in pretty much everything under the sun :sunny:. This profile is limited to my interest in Software Engineering.

- :seedling:I am currently enhancing my skills in Java and the Spring framework, while also learning the nuts and bolts of how to leverage Generative AI to build more 
     impactful software applications.
- :telescope:I am primarily aiming to become a backend engineer. Anything that goes into implementing the business logic of an application is what I find more 
     interesting. 

## My Projects :hammer_and_wrench: 

1. A URL shortener App : https://github.com/akhilVogeti/URLShortener. 
   Built using Springboot + MySQL + Redis. Docker for containerisation. It also follows Strategy Design Pattern.

3. To-do list App : https://github.com/akhilVogeti/todo.
   Built using Springboot + MongoDB, this application helps perform CRUD operations on tasks and task lists along with search and sort functionalities.

For more detailed info on projects, do visit the github links.

## Why Software Engineering fascinates me :computer: 

1. The sheer scale of impact. The idea that the code that you write can potentially impact so many users is awe-inspiring. Imagine the scale of UPI(Unified Payments 
    Interface) or a facebook. Or the portal that helps you file your tax returns. Tech makes life easy, and it does that at scale.
   
2. Software Engineering is like math. You simply cant build anything without it. Engineering without a software component no longer exists.



## If you are a recruiter :black_nib:

I am decently competent in Java, Springboot, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc and will quickly learn any other tech I need in order to do my job. In addition to my technical skills, here are some additional strengths I bring: 

1. I can understand your product well. No matter what it is. You could be building a medical device, a social media platform, a fintech, or even a vanilla CRUD 
   application,  whatever the product, I can develop a deeper understanding of its use case, user experience, and market expectations. It is what I think would help me 
   contribute better as an engineer. This context in which engineering happens is often overlooked.
   
2. I am fairly articulate. I believe in being clear in my communication. It's impossible for a team to function smoothly without it. 

3. I am adaptable and I love learning new things. I pick up skills, both technical and non technical, fairly quickly.

4. I bring a disciplined work ethic. Being a good engineer is also about inculcating discipline and being committed to the work that you do.
