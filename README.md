## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious chap who is interested in pretty much everything under the sun :sunny:. This profile is limited to my interest in Software Engineering.

- :seedling:I am currently enhancing my skills in Java and the Spring framework, while also learning the nuts and bolts of how to leverage Generative AI to build more 
     impactful software applications. Started learning JavaScript and NodeJS. 
- :telescope:I am primarily aiming to become a backend engineer. Translating business logic into working code is just fascinating. 

## My Projects :hammer_and_wrench: 

1. A URL shortener App : https://github.com/akhilVogeti/URLShortener <br>
   Built using Springboot + MySQL + Redis. Docker for containerisation. It also follows Strategy Design Pattern.

2. To-do list App : https://github.com/akhilVogeti/todo <br>
   Built using Springboot + MongoDB, this application helps perform CRUD operations on tasks and task lists along with search and sort functionalities.

3. AI powered Q&A bot : https://github.com/akhilVogeti/chatBot <br>
   A short python project that uses OpenAI's llm to answer questions based on uploaded pdf or input text content.

4. TaskApp : https://github.com/akhilVogeti/TaskApp <br>
   A task manager app with NodeJS backend, MongoDB, and a basic UI using react. Registered users can manager their tasks after logging in.

## Why Software Engineering fascinates me :computer: 

1. The sheer scale of impact. <br>
   The idea that the code you write can potentially impact so many users is awe-inspiring. Imagine the scale of UPI(Unified Payments Interface) or a facebook. Or the 
   portal that helps you file your tax returns. Tech makes life easy, and it does that at scale.
   
3. You simply cant build anything without it. <br>
   From connecting people across continents to raising productivity in every sector, digital tools have become indispensable 
   in nearly every aspect of human endeavor.


## If you are a recruiter :black_nib:

I am decently competent in Java, Springboot, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc and will quickly learn any other tech I need in order to do my job. In addition to my technical skills, here are some additional strengths I bring: 

1. I can understand your product well. No matter what it is. <br>
   Whether you're developing a medical device, a social media platform, a fintech solution, or a simple CRUD application, I can develop a deeper understanding of its use 
   case, user experience, and market expectations. This is what I think would help me contribute better as an engineer. 
   
3. I am fairly articulate. I believe in being clear in my communication. It's impossible for a team to function smoothly without it. 

4. I am adaptable and I love learning new things. I pick up skills, both technical and non technical, fairly quickly.

5. I bring a disciplined work ethic. Being a good engineer is also about inculcating discipline and being committed to the work that you do.
